# SoundForge - A Digital Subtractive Synthesizer
<sup>v0.7.0</sup>  
SoundForge is a digital audio synthesizer.

## Installation
Simply clone the files, and use the setup.py file to compile DSPcmath.pyx into a binary file that the SoundForge can use.

## Usage
Run mainx-x-x.py with a Python interperater to launch the synthesizer. SoundForge should automatically interface with any connected MIDI device.

## Coming Soon
- [ ] Better documentation!
- [ ] More of the synth implemented in C, as currently it takes a good machine to run smoothly.
